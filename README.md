# 3D Designer Portfolio

### Youtube Video: [Project Live Video](https://youtube.com)

## Introduction

My brother recently graduated from 3D design school and as a gift I decided to make a website for him to showcase his projects and as an opportunity for me to learn new technologies and improve my programming skills.

## Technologies

To showcase one of the best projects my brother did was to use a Javascript library that enable to render 3D models on browsers, and Three.js was perfect for that job.

I planned to use a javascript library on a React.js website so I could learn a Javascript framework to create interactive websites and Use other Technologies to complement the project.

I want to become a web developer specializing in the JavasScript framework React, and I thought this will be a great opportunity to learn and improve my knowledge on the subject.
React is a good framework to create SPA(simple page applications) and create interactive websites.
Threejs made it possible to display 3D models on the website creating cameras and making it possible to rotate the model and check it from different angles.
TailwindCSS allows you to with CSS inside the html tags and move fast designing styles for each element on the website.
Framer Motion helped me add cool animations to the project making it look clean and modern.
Maath as an npm package math algorithm.
### Technologies Used

1. [React.js](https://react.dev/) as a web development framework.
   React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components
2. [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) as a 3D model renderer for the website.
   Three. js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL
3. [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as a CSS framework.
Tailwind CSS helps you eject from the complexity of abstracting styles away. Having styles right there in your HTML is powerful
4. [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) as a frontend tool.
   Vite delivers your code via native native ES Module imports during development,        allowing you to create single-file components without having to bundle them.
5. [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) as an Animation Library.
   Framer Motion is a simple yet powerful motion library for React. It powers the amazing animations and interactions in Framer, the web builder for creative pros
6. [maath](https://www.npmjs.com/package/maath) as a Math npm package for helping to display the 3D model.
   This is a collection of useful math helpers, random generators, bits and bobs.
7. [emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/) as an email handler.
   EmailJS is a backend-as-a-service that gives you the tools to send emails to the users of your application directly from your client or server-side code to fit your business requirements.

## Project Description

The project is a web portfolio displaying one big 3D model of a dragon design, sculpt and model on Blender software. I use Three Js JavaScript library to be able to render the model without issues in the browser.

In the next section it displays the skill of the 3D designer and I use frame motion to slide in the cards and create a smooth animation and an over effect tilting the cards with the mouse cursor.

In the next section display the 3d artist experience in a timeline, the section map through a json file in which can be updated with more items and will be automatically added to the website with the experience component. Benice the experience there are policons with the technologies the artist knows.

The next seccion is a group of cards displaying the finished projects made by the designer during the course and free time with the sliding and tilt effect. If the cards are clicked it opens a new tab redirecting the user to a more detail of the project in [Artstation](https://artstation.com). The card includes a picture of the project, a small description, and tags with the used technologies.

The following section includes cards with the testimonial and reference of other artists and professionals in the area, including the testimonial, name, title and picture.

The last section includes an Earth globe with a continuous rotation that can be changed with the mouse in the background to a group of stars that are placed randomly with the npm package maath and rotation on a pivot point. This section includes a form that sends a mail to the artist directly thanks to emailjs that allow to send emails directly from the frontend without server

## Impressions

This project allows me to improve my abilities as a developer by understanding how different technologies can connect and work together to solve everyday problems during development and help you find solutions that satisfy the overall goal of the project. I enjoyed a lot during the development of this project and I am very delighted with the result.
